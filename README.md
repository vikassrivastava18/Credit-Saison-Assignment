For the requirements of creating two endpoints and displaying the data on button clicks, a SPA might be a good solution.
Have created the endpoints (api_1, api_2), for card-search and staistics.
Used Javascript fetch API and History API for creating a SPA (https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/notes/6/).
